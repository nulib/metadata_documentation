			<title>African Governance and Collaborative Learning: Confronting Predation, Poverty, and Conflict</title>

			<lds02>In this talk and related activities, I hope to inspire others to take up one of the greatest challenges of our era: narrowing the governance gap which is at the root of many of Africa&#8217;s development and security dilemmas. In view of the emergence of many fragile and failed states, a wave of innovative thinking and action is urgently needed. According to Roger Myerson, Nobel Laureate in Economics, &#8220;the key question in Africa is how can governance be improved&#8221;. Answers will only be found, I believe, through a process of collaborative learning and research. No single scholar or analyst can unravel the complex dimensions of this issue in Africa&#8217;s diverse contexts. The engagement of the Academy in meeting this challenge is vital. An invitation to review a strategy document on economic governance for 2019-2013 of a major African organization has added to the uniqueness of this moment.</lds02>
